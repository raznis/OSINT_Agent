# OSINT Money Laundering Detection Application
## Requirements and Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan for an Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) application designed to identify potential money laundering red flags associated with individuals and businesses. The application will leverage CrewAI as the agent orchestration framework, Brave MCP for web searches, and frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) for information analysis and structured output generation. The user interface will be built using Gradio.

## 2. Project Goals

- Create an OSINT tool that gathers comprehensive information about individuals and businesses from publicly available sources
- Identify potential money laundering indicators based on analysis of the gathered information
- Present findings in a structured, actionable format to assist in financial crime investigations
- Provide an intuitive user interface that allows for easy input and clear presentation of results
